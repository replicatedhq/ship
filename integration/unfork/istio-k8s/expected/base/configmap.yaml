      # The mode used to redirect inbound connections to Envoy. This setting
      # has no effect on outbound traffic: iptables REDIRECT is always used for
      # outbound connections.
      # If "REDIRECT", use iptables REDIRECT to NAT and redirect to Envoy.
      # The "REDIRECT" mode loses source addresses during redirection.
      # If "TPROXY", use iptables TPROXY to redirect to Envoy.
      # The "TPROXY" mode preserves both the source and destination IP
      # addresses and ports, so that they can be used for advanced filtering
      # and manipulation.
      # The "TPROXY" mode also configures the sidecar to run with the
      # CAP_NET_ADMIN capability, which is required to use TPROXY.
