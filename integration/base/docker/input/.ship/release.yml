# assets are everything an end customer needs to deploy your application, like
#
#  - kubernetes or docker-compose manifests
#  - installation scripts
#  - modules for ansible/chef/puppet
#  - private docker images
#  - compiled artifacts and binaries
#
# assets will be templated using customer-supplied
# install info from the "config" section (below)
assets:
  v1:
    # "inline" can be used to supply assets directly in the spec
    - inline:
        contents: |
          #!/bin/bash
          echo "installing nothing"
          echo "config option: {{repl ConfigOption "test_option" }}"

# Config defines the configuration options available to your application.
# Values supplied by the end customer will be used during asset generation.

# Lifecycle allows you to customize the messaging and workflow for your end customer
# when they are generating assets. Currently the two support lifecycle steps are
#
#  - message -- prints a message
#  - render  -- collects config and generates assets
