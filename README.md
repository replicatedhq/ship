![Replicated Ship](https://github.com/replicatedhq/ship/blob/master/logo/logo.png)

Ship enables the operation of third-party applications through modern software deployment pipelines (i.e. GitOps). Ship is a command line and UI that prepares workflows to enable deploying and updating of Helm charts, Kubernetes applications and other third-party software. Ship handles the process of merging custom settings (`state.json`) with custom overlays (using Kustomize), and preparing a deployable set of assets (an application). Ship is designed to provide first-time configuration UI and/or be used headless in a CI/CD pipeline to automate deployment of third party applications. 

Ship is launching with first-class support for Helm charts designed at automating the "last-mile" of custom configuration via Kustomize.

# Features
- Web based "admin console" to provide initial configuration of Helm values and create Kustomize overlays
- Ability to run with or without the admin console to support running in headless and automated pipelines
- Merge Helm charts with override values and then with custom overlays using Kustomize
- Deploy Helm charts without tiller to a Kubernetes cluster
- Enables GitOps workflows to update third party applications

# Operating modes

## ship init
Prepares a new application for deployment. Use for:
- Generating initial config (state.json) for an application
- Creating and managing Kustomize overlays to be applied before deployment

## ship update
Updates an existing application by merging the latest release with the local state and overlays. Use for:
- Preparing an update to be deployed to a third party application
- Automating the update process to start from a continuous integration (CI) service

# Installation
There are two ways you can get started with Ship:

## Running in docker
To run ship in docker:
```shell
docker run replicated/ship init <path-to-chart> # github.com/kubernetes/charts/mysql
```

## Installing locally
Ship is packaged as a single binary, and Linux and MacOS versions are distributed:
- To download the latest Linux build, run:
```shell
curl -Lo ship https://github.com/replicatedhq/ship/releases/download/v0.14.0/ship_0.14.0_linux_amd64.tar.gz && chmod +x ship && sudo mv ship /usr/local/bin
```

- To download the latest MacOS build, run:
```shell
curl -Lo ship https://github.com/replocatedhq/ship/releases/download/v0.14.0/ship-0.14.0_darwin-amd64.tar.gz && chmod +x ship && sudo mv ship /usr/local/bin
```

After ship is installed, run it with:

```shell
ship init <path-to-chart> # github.com/kubernetes/charts/mysql
```

# Demo

# CI/CD Integration
Once you've prepared an application using `ship init`, the deployable application assets can be generated, using any version of the application, by running:

```shell
ship update <path-to-chart> # github.com/kubernetes/charts/mysql
```

## Jenkins
An [example Jenkins job](https://github.com/replicatedhq/ship/tree/master/examples/jenkins) is available that illustrates how to run `ship update` to receive updates to a third party application in a CI/CD process.
