```
yarn start
```
Development mode uses [`webpack-dashboard`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard) for more human-readable output.

To build the project without watching:
- Development build (no minification, warnings off):
  ```
  yarn build-dev
  ```
- Production build (minified/uglified):
  ```
  yarn build
  ```
