# Webpack library starter: webpack 4 + babel 6 + mocha + chai + typescript 2.9

Originated from [here](https://github.com/pmunin/webpack-library-starter) and adapted for typescript

Webpack based boilerplate for producing libraries (Input: typescript/ES6, Output: universal library)

## What's different in this fork

* typescript modules supported, they can reference js modules and js modules can ref typescript

## TODO

* [ ] clean package.json dependencies
* [ ] make test build have separate node_modules.js, like dev build
* [ ] generated libs should have jsdoc comments in it
* [x] create solution for typescript
* [ ] generate typescript definitions correctly
