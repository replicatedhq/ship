### NOTE

This is totally copy-pasted from [the support bundle docs generation](https://github.com/replicatedhq/support-bundle) so there may be some extra stuff that doesn't make sense but didn't yet get removed.

#### TLDR:

 1. Make changes to the `api.Spec` type
 1. Run this in dev container
    ```
    make deps build pipeline
    ```
 1. Copy generated `schema.json` file into the [replicatedhq/replicated-linter](https://github.com/replicatedhq/replicated-lint/tree/master/projects/replicated-ship) project.
 1. In `replicated-lint` project run
    ```
    make project-import PROJECT=replicated-ship
    ```

### continuing...

This is a pretty big pile of tech debt at the moment. Its janky, untested,
undocumented. It generates json from golang types, modifies it, validates the final product,
and then generates markdown for help center.

This is less of an experiment now than it was when we started, so it should
probably get cleaned up somehow, maybe npm-module'd or something.

Currently has several steps:

- generate jsonschema from go source, dump to `schema.json`
- modify generated jsonschema to add descriptions and examples from `mutations.json`
- (optional) validate the modified jsonschema to ensure all spec keys have examples and descriptions
- Turn the modified jsoncschema into schema.md, uses jsonschema-md to generate reference docs
- clean up the schema.md file with sed (because `jsonschema-md` is a crappy library and I might say we should get rid of it someday)
- generate build/... a bunch of markdown files to be copied into help-center

The contents of schema.md and schema2.md can then be pasted into the help-center hugo site or wherever.

## Contributing

`mutations.json` is the only file that should be modified to extend the generated schema. The following files are committed, but autogenerated:

```
schema.json

### Make commands

Two make commands for e2e, one with validation `make pipeline-strict` and one without `make pipeline`:
